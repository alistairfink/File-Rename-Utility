# File Rename Utility

Utility to rename all files in folder to a number while preserving file extension.

Note: This was created for a very niche situation. I don't expect this to be useful for anyone.

## Example of Usage:
### Input:
```
Enter Full Absolute Path: C:\test
```
### Output:
```
Renamed: C:\test\dab.txt to: C:\test\1.txt
Renamed: C:\test\yeet.txt to: C:\test\2.txt
Renamed: C:\test\yolo.txt to: C:\test\3.txt
```
### Directory Before:
```
dab.txt
yeet.txt
yolo.txt
```
### Directory After:
```
1.txt
2.txt
3.txt
```
## Does Not Support
* Subfolders
* Files with no extension
